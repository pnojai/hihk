## A beginning is a delicate time

I'm trying out static site generation.

- Bookdown in RStudio.
- Archive on GitHub.
- Build with Hugo.
- Host on Netlify with continuous integration.

Already some gotchas. I have to change the default location for a post to "posts" in the Blogdown addin for a new post.
