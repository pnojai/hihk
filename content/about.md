## Jai Jeffryes - Data Scientist and Classical Pianist

Those who know me know I like hats, and I wear many of them.

I am a graduate student in Data Science at CUNY in New York City. I assist research at the Sulzer Neuroscience Sulzer Laboratory at Columbia University as a data analyst and programmer.

With 20 years of experience as a database administrator and programmer behind me, I attended a seminar by Edward Tufte, who inspired me to drop everything and devote myself to data science. Meanwhile, is any endeavor more relevant and pressing now than securing public health? I intend to exploit data science in the field of public health with a focus on epidemiology.

I am a professional musician with performances worldwide from North America to Paris, Berlin, and Tokyo, from the Ambassador Auditorium in Los Angeles to Lincoln Center in New York. My focus is on contemporary classical piano music. I produce recordings released on Composers Concordance Records and my own label, Steel Wig Records. I'm a Voting Member of The Recording Academy and vote in the Grammy Awards.
