Max Kuhn, author of the `caret` package (**C**lassification **A**nd **RE**gression **T**raining), the indispensible and universally acclaimed `R` toolbox for machine learning, [announced](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2020/04/tidymodels-org/) yesterday (April 21, 2020) the launch of [tidymodels.org](https://www.tidymodels.org). The site is a central location for learning and using the `tidymodels` framework, a collection of packages for modeling and machine learning based on Tidyverse principles.

I'm headed over there now for the Getting Started articles. It's time to ramp up my machine learning skills on the new framework. Kuhn says he'll continue to support bug fixes for `caret`, but new development goes into `tidymodels`. He says everything you could do in `caret` you're supposed to be able to do now in `tidymodels`.
