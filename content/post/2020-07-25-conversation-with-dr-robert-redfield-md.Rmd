I see CDC Director, Dr. Robert R. Redfield, MD all the time on the news and appearing before Congress. The interview below is a live stream from July 14, 2020. Seeing Dr. Redfield in a loosened up environment in conversation with a colleague revealed a lot more of him. I learned about his background, his experience, and who he is as a man. It solidified my respect.

In his interview, Dr. Redfield shares very interesting perspectives about the mission of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about the role of public service, and about leadership. I learned a lot and I especially enjoyed getting to know him a little better.

The interviewer is Dr. Howard Bauchner, the editor-in-chief of the *Journal of the American Medical Association*. I subscribe to the JAMA Network on YouTube, so I can view his series of interviews, called "Conversations with Dr. Bauchner," that illuminate health topics for a wide audience.
