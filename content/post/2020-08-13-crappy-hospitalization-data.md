The crappy hospitalization data is why I prefer to review status by state based on excess deaths.

On the other hand, vital statistics reporting is long established, very complete, and very accurate. If you look at all-cause mortality, you take out of the equation questions of coincidence of morbidity and viral positivity. If a state's deaths from all causes are back in line with expectations from prior years, then burden of mortality is back to normal and it doesn't matter if you detected or reported viral infection.
