My daily review (blogs, news, papers, plots) exposed me to a few things that I looked up, and this is a capture of some links.

- [Thomas Basbøll will like this post (analogy between common—indeed, inevitable—mistakes in drawing, and inevitable mistakes in statistical reasoning).](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2020/08/13/thomas-basboll-will-like-this-post-analogy-between-common-indeed-inevitable-mistakes-in-drawing-and-inevitable-mistakes-in-statistical-reasoning/). From Andrew Gelman. Examples of summarizing data.
- [The Millennium Villages Project: a retrospective,
observational, endline evaluation](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/millennium_final.pdf). Andrew's example of how to do it.
- [The failure of null hypothesis significance testing when studying incremental changes, and what to do about it](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/incrementalism_3.pdf). Andrew Gelman. Section 2.2 shows what **not** to do.

Some public health related references I looked up when reading the Millenium Villages Project study above.

- [Millennium Development Goals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Development_Goals). I needed a refresher about those.
- [5 Tips for Baseline and Endline Surveys](https://dimagi.com/blog/data-collection-baseline-endline-surveys/). The paper above is an endline evaluation of the Millenium Villages Project intervention. What is that?
