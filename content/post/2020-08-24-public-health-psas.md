In my post [What do you mean communication is the biggest challenge?](https://datascience.jeffryes.net/post/what-do-you-mean-communication-is-the-biggest-challenge/), I observed social contexts antithetical to effective communication directed towards serving public health objectives, contexts like distrust of science, proliferation of misinformation like conspiracy theories, and politicization of health policy. I asserted that effective health messaging must establish credibility and foster a receptive environment. I suggested leveraging techniques of public relations and advertising towards those ends in order to achieve desirable outcomes of healthy choices made by informed communities.

Vital Strategies, a global health organization is doing just that, working with Association pour la Defense des Droits des Consommateaurs (ADC), a civil society group that has partnered with Ministries of Health in Chad, Togo, Benin, Niger and Burkina Faso. Each country is mounting a campaign of radio spots to encourage behaviors to reduce the spread of COVID-19.

This article presents more about the communication project: [Fighting COVID-19 on the Airwaves and in the Markets: Coordinated Campaigns for Protective Behaviors](https://preventepidemics.org/stories/fighting-covid-19-on-the-airwaves-and-in-the-markets-coordinated-campaigns-for-protective-behaviors/). *Community engagement is a cornerstone of successful risk communication*.

We need more such engagement in the United States.
