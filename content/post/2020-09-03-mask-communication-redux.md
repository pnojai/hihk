The site [PreventEpidemics.org](https://preventepidemics.org/), from Resolve to Save Lives and Vital Strategies has added to its resources a [Mask Guidance Playbook](https://preventepidemics.org/covid19/resources/mask-playbook/)

> Promoting mask use is one of the key interventions governments, communities, businesses, and other organizations can implement to control COVID-19.

The Playbook includes communication strategies, monitoring approaches, and more. This is a step in the right direction, relating to my own post about the need for more effective public health messaging, [What do you mean communication is the biggest challenge?](https://datascience.jeffryes.net/post/what-do-you-mean-communication-is-the-biggest-challenge/).

I think the program could show even more promise if it examined and addressed additional barriers to compliance. The barriers cited in the [Policymakers Guide](https://preventepidemics.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Promoting-Mask-Wearing-During-COVID-19.pdf), like not believing a threat is urgent or believing others will think a mask wearer is sick, etc., are meaningful. Nevertheless, I think a messaging strategy would be even more effective by addressing these barriers I mention in my post.

- Distrust of expertise.
- Distrust of science.
- Distrust of government.
- Overarching anti-intellectualism.
- Theorizing about conspiracies, especially on social media, and misinformation in general.
- Politicization of science.
- Politicization of health policy.
- Prominent unhealthy role models in government and society.
- Lack of expert consensus.
- Contradictory policy guidance.

I wrote to the authors of the Mask Guidance Playbook to make the suggestion. It will be interesting to see if I receive a response.
