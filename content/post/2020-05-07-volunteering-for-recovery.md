Do you need tech assistance during the recovery? Data reporting, spreadsheet untangling, database backing up?

If you need help treading these choppy waters, get in touch and maybe I can help. I would particularly like to hear from you if you are:

- A public health non-profit,
- In New York City, or
- In Troy, Ohio. (My hometown.)
